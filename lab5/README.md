## Lab5

In this assignment your task is to make computer play games. Of course, we limit ourselves to a very limited subset of games: two players, zero sum, perfect information, deterministic games. These properties may require some explanation:

- _Two players_ is pretty straightforward: there are exactly two players. Any less is a puzzle (see previous classes), any more is interesting (but out of scope).
- _Zero sum_ means that a win of one player is necessarly a loss of the other player. For example, if one player wins the game having 100 points, the other player must have exactly -100 points.
- _Perfect information_ means that there are no hidden variables in the game, like some cards kept in secret by players. Both players can see exactly the same thing.
- _Deterministic_ means that there is no randomness in the game, no dices, no decks of cards, etc.

Each and every of these assumptions can be relaxed, yielding a more complex variant of the problem of playing games.
