In this assignment, we will use PyTorch, one of the most popular deep learning libraries out there. Similarly to programming languages, deep learning libraries can be very different in terms of syntax, yet they all revolve around the same concepts, so once you master one, learning another is much less challenging. We also use `seaborn` to plot charts and `scikit-learn` to download datasets. The three cells below should install, respectively:

1. PyTorch: `torch` and `torchvision`, version at least `1.13` (2022/23 remark: version 1.13 is the most recent stable version and we use one freshly added feature)
2. Seaborn
3. `scikit-learn` version at least `0.23`.
